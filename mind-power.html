	Since ancient times the powers of the moon have played an important part in the folklore and legend of almost every culture. The full moon in particular is known to have immense energy that is said to give an extra punch to many spiritual, psychic, and magickal practices.</p>
	<p>Moonlight is actually sunlight reflected by the moon, which of course is energy, and like a woman, it has its monthly cycle. All of the phases of that cycle can be helpful for different purposes, depending on what your specific goals are. A detailed description of the phases of the moon can be checked out on the official NASA website (www.nasa.gov)</p>
	<p>As far as magick goes a full moon makes for a gorgeous backdrop if spells are cast outdoors at night, and can have a powerful psychological boost. If you want to cast a spell at any time, then go ahead, but some people do like to time their spells to coincide with the different moon phases. The waxing moon is a good time for renewal, to include rituals that bring things into your life or increase them (love, for example), for binding spells, or to begin a new phase in something. Conversely, the waning moon is the ideal phase  (especially during the dark moon) for closing things, for moving things away from you, for performing banishing rituals, and so on.</p>
	<p>The full moon in particular is a great time to charge any crystals, gems or metals that you have. Leave them in the moonlight overnight, on a bed of earth if you can manage it (since earth has its own potent energy), and retrieve them the following morning.</p>
	<p>In terms of psychic perception, certain lunar phases can enhance your sessions, while others less so. If you are deliberately using any form of telepathy or remote influence, you may find that your results are more dramatic during the waxing and full moon phase. The full moon amplifies our emotions, so in the case of remote seduction and telepathy, where emotions play a vital role, one can take advantage of this by having longer, more intense,  or more frequent sessions during this time.</p>
	<p>Having said the above, it's important to understand that although the different phases of the moon can give a boost, spells or psi work can be effective regardless of the phase that they were performed in. You may get the urge to cast a spell or to perform a telepathy ritual at any time, whether it's ideal or not, and that's perfectly fine. The bottom line is, if you BELIEVE that a waning moon will weaken your telepathic powers, or that a waxing moon will super-charge your love spells, then your results will be affected accordingly.</p>

	Imagine having the ability -  using little more than the power of your own thoughts- to make anyone you choose be crazily attracted to you or to fall in madly love with you. This ability would work even if you were not normally their type, or if circumstances happened to be an obstacle. Well, we are all telepathic beings, and many of us do have the potential to learn what is called "remote seduction". In this first of a series of posts, we will be concentrating on what remote seduction is, what it's effects are, plus some general information.<p>
	<p>Remote seduction (RS) is a specialized form of telepathy that uses the power of touch and emotion to psychically seduce the person of your choice (your "target") in order to plant romantic feelings and erotic desire in them. These feelings attract them to you specifically, causing them to want to be with you in whatever way you choose - be it a committed love relationship or simply a brief sexual encounter. As with all kinds of mind-to-mind communication, distance is irrelevant; the technique can work equally well whether the target is right beside you, or across the ocean in another country.</p>
	<p>When it comes to this particular topic, people will inevitably argue about free will and the ethics of it. Whether this use of psychic influence is right or wrong is subjective and we must use our own intuition to guide us. As mentioned earlier, you can attract a person for a sexual encounter, a love affair - or any kind of romantic relationship - with just a few weeks of regular rs. However, caution and common sense need to be used if you are to be influencing the target over an extended period of time (8-12 weeks or more). The feelings of love and attraction can become quite a bit stronger with rs than if the target had been attracted or fallen in love in the regular way, without any psychic influencing. Therefore, it should not be viewed as a game to be used with frivolity. It is about deliberately influencing a person's emotions quite drastically. The rs-er will be on the target's mind much of the time and it can easily reach the stage where they love and desire the rs-er to the exclusion of anybody else, and those feelings will endure. It is important to consider how much you really want the target before embarking on this particular journey. But if you are genuinely serious about wanting the person and do decide to proceed, the results can be astonishing..</p>
	<p>There are many different ways to do rs. You can imagine various scenarios with them; you can create energy balls and fill them with the feeling of desire which you then send to them; you can do "live" rs, where you mentally caress random people in a public place or when the target is talking to you; you can mentally "step in" to a person to control their thoughts, and so on. For this post we will be concentrating on a basic session that is divided up into two main parts:</p>
	<p><strong>1. Sexual RS</strong></p>
	<p>The first part is a form of sexual rs, that is intended to plant erotic feelings for you into the target. This consists primarily of scenario- building where you imagine making love with them in any way that you would like to in real life. For this technique to be really effective, you must visualize in first person, as if the target were actually there in front of you. In other words, you would not see the two of you as if you were watching a home video: rather, you would see just your own hands or lower body, exactly as you do in real life.</p>
	<p>The backbone of this fantasy scene is psychic "touching", where you mentally fondle and excite the target in a sensual, erotic manner. This works because telepathically these psychic "caresses" will actually be experienced by the person in some way or other. Typically there will be a feeling of heat, pressure, tingling or throbbing in the area that is being caressed. A trail of sexual images involving themselves and the rs-er may begin to flicker through their imagination. These "flash" images are not unlike the early moving pictures of the early 1900s, only they tend to be rather more brief. But no matter how short-lived they are, the target will be aroused by them. Often (this happens more and more once you have been rsing them regularly) they will begin to associate the experiences with you and it will lead to fantasizing and desire for you. To exactly what degree the person will feel your caresses will largely depend on how skilled you are, but the more adept you become, the more often you rs them and the more that time passes, the more intensely the person will be affected. Developing the ability to seduce a person remotely takes time, but with enough skill from your side, your target will become sexually excited in exactly the same way (and possibly even more) than they would if they were having a real-life encounter with you. Their body will respond accordingly by experiencing wetness/ hardness, their mind will take on a life of its own where it is flooded with lustful thoughts and a desire for sexual release, and so on. This feeling of arousal can last from anything between a few moments to several hours, and is usually delightfully addictive to anyone experiencing it. If the target is especially affected by a session, he/she can find themselves craving a repeat experience even years later: rs can be that powerful.</p>
	<p>Many people fear that if they are creating sexual arousal in their target, then that person will start to work off their desires by seeking out sex with someone else. This is only really likely to happen if you put too much emphasis on the lustful side of things at the expense of emotional or love RS. Lust in the absence of love will cause people to want release their sexual urges with whoever happens to be around. Balance is key here. Love mixed with lust/sexual desire is a lethal combination so rest assured that if you are careful to include at least some scenes of affection in with your sexual rs, the target will respond accordingly. They will feel drawn to you like crazy and you alone. After all it is your own unique personal energy that the target is being affected by. Anyone else but you will seem a poor substitute, especially if you have some kind of regular contact with the person; they will start fantasizing about you exclusively.</p>
	<p><strong>2. Love RS</strong></p>
	<p>The second segment of RS is intended to arouse feelings of romantic love for you in your target - of tenderness, and deep affection. This again consists of scenario building and visualizing in first person, but in this case it is all about the emotional aspect rather than the sexual. The focus is on them loving you rather than lusting after you (although with practice the two states can be combined for extra impact). The scenes can be whatever you choose, but if you are wishing the target to fall in love with you it is helpful to include them looking deeply into your eyes and telling you how much they love you, want to be with you, how no one else but you will do for them, and so on. The imaginal scenes that you create will filter into the target's mind so completely that it is not uncommon to find that they actually repeat the very same words to the rs-er in real life. What will get through with stunning accuracy, is the emotion you are attempting to convey. The target will feel what you want them to feel, and they will assume that it is their own idea. This is what makes this part of the remote seduction session so very powerful.</p>
	<p><strong>The Importance of Regular Sessions</strong></p>
	<p>Continuous rs is vital. A lot of people fall into the trap of believing that they can just do sessions when they feel like it - in a haphazard way - or just a couple of times, and that it will work. Although there are occasional exceptions (usually when the rs-er is extremely adept), this will not work in the vast majority of cases. For the first 8 weeks or so, RS needs to be relentless (or at least 5 days per week) if it is to successfully hack into the psyche of the person you are wishing to seduce.</p>
	<p><strong>Your Energy</strong></p>
	<p>It is vital to remember that your own energy means everything when it comes to psychic seduction. It is the difference between success and failure. There are a number of traps that the rs-er can fall into that are counterproductive to your success and can even block the process entirely. Do not obsess about the target. Do not stalk their social media or spend hours discussing them with friends - what they are doing or with whom. Do not contact them endlessly. Do not be impatient to see results or keep asking why nothing has happened yet. Do your sessions and then when you have finished, turn your attention to something else. The results will come if you don't try to force them to come.</p>
	<p><strong>Your Attitude</strong></p>
	<p>Studies in parapsychology (telepathy, remote seduction, remote viewing, etc) have demonstrated that the less open people are to their own psychic abilities, the less successful they will be with them. Thoughts are things, and we literally can do what we believe we can do. If we believe that we have an innate gift at remote seduction, then in time we will inevitably prove ourself right and it will happen exactly in line with our thinking. If, on the other hand, we are full of doubt and are not really convinced that we really can seduce a person at a distance, then yes, we will be correct in our assumption. So start from now on to see yourself in a confident light - as a skilled remote seducer. Affirm to yourself daily with an attitude that you mean business sentences such as: "My rs is incredibly powerful!" and "I can attract anyone I want with my rs", "I am the world's most gifter rs-er", etc. Play make-believe that you have a super gift that few others have. See yourself as part of an elite group of people who can mold their destiny like clay, in exactly the way that they wish. Believe it with absolute conviction, and all of this will be so.</p>
	<p><strong>The Effects of Remote Seduction on the Target:</strong></p>
	<p>We have already covered the physical/emotional sensations that the target will feel in the moments and hours after being "rs-ed". While an rs-er can occasionally affect their target strongly with just a single session (particularly if they are very skilled), most people find that the effects take a while to build up (see the post: "Remote Seduction Series Part 3 - Why You Need to Give Your Influence Time to Set In"). More often than not, these initial effects will be weak - perhaps barely detectable. But as time passes and the connection between rs-er and target intensifies, the influence will begin to take root and unless the target makes an effort to hide it, the effects will become increasingly obvious. If sessions are carried out over the long term (8-12 weeks or more), then it is not uncommon for the target to find themselves attracted to you and only you. Once you reach the 12-week mark, the effects will have stuck to the target: their passion and desire for you will become a part of their own way of thinking. Twenty-four weeks of continuous remote seduction will become deeply etched in their psyche. From then on, if you continue to do sessions on them, that desire will continue to consume them. However, even if you decide to discontinue your sessions at that point, their feelings for you will endure to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the individual and how well they were influenced. The feelings may fade a little into the background if you are out of contact with each other for an extended period of time, but they will be re-ignited whenever you think of them or encounter them again. The once temporary effects will become permanent - possibly lasting for the rest of the target's life.</p>
	<p><strong>Once Your Goal Has Been Reached</strong></p>
	<p>Once you have reached your goal and are in a relationship with your target (if that's what you were aiming for), you can either give up the remote seduction, or you can reduce the number of sessions and the amount of time spent on them. The target's feelings for you after over 12 weeks of regular rs will be permanent: they won't fade even after you give them up. Some people like to keep up just a little bit of rs because they find that it keeps the passion extra hot in the relationship, but it is not essential.</p>
	<p>It's important to keep in mind that once you are in a relationship, you need to work on it in exactly the same way that you would in one that had not been induced with rs. Treat the person well and you will have a happy, fulfilling, and solid relationship; treat them badly or take them for granted and it can harm what you have together.</p>
	<p>If you have rs-d the person for a shorter period of time (say, less than 4-6 weeks), their feelings for you will usually begin to fade out gradually if you stop working on them, particularly if  they had no natural attraction for you before you began your sessions. If they were naturally attracted to you at the outset, then even short-term rs can have a longer lasting effect.</p>
	<p>In part 2 of this series, we will be going through the steps of an rs session.</p>

	Remote seduction (RS), where you use your psychic powers alone to "seduce" a person remotely( see the previous post: "Remote Seduction Series Part 1: The Method Explained"), is a technique that requires a degree of skill that can only come through regular practice. In theory the steps are not that difficult to work through, but they can take a bit of time to grasp fully.  Reading up on the subject is the first step. There are several books that cover the general concept in detail which need to be read and re-read over and over until it has been fully absorbed (see the list at the end of this post). Reading  posts from the remote seduction series of this blog will also help you to gain insights. From then onwards discipline, training, regular practice, observation, plus trial-and-error are the keys to mastering it.  There is no "one-size-fits-all" when it comes to remote seduction: your own sessions will evolve into something as unique as your fingerprint, based on your level of knowledge and experience. In this post we will not be entering too much into what rs is, or exactly how the target will react, how long it will take, and so on.. Instead we will be going over the basic steps and how to incorporate them into your life.</p>
	<p><strong>Planning Your Sessions</strong></p>
	<p>The effects of rs on the target can last from anything between a few minutes to several hours. With this in mind, you need to arrange your sessions to consistently top up these feelings.</p>
	<p>It is a good idea, if possible, to schedule your sessions for the roughly same time (within a two-hour radius) every day, for a minimum of twice a day. Some people prefer twice-daily rs sessions and some prefer three or more. How many you do is entirely up to you, but make them regular. It is important that your plan be realistic and that you avoid letting your enthusiasm get the better of you. Deciding to do six sessions a day would most likely burn you out fast and will be pointless. It also indicates impatience and desperation to achieve your goal. Desperation and impatience are energies that will greatly reduce the effects of your psychic seduction work. At their worst, they can actually repel your target (since this is telepathy, and the target will feel all of your energies). So try to maintain a confident, patient attitude within a realistic structure. Be open to the idea that rs works, and it will work.</p>
	<p>Duration of the sessions is also up to you, but try to keep to no less than 15 minutes per session. 30-45 minutes is ideal. Whatever you decide on, keep it to something realistic and manageable.</p>
	<p><strong>Creating Structure</strong></p>
	<p>The content of your sessions will depend on what you want from the relationship you are attracting with your chosen person (your "target"), and how long you have been working on them for. If you want nothing more than a sexual relationship with them, then you can skip "love rs" and "soulmate rs" (see below) and just get on with the erotic aspect of the session. But if you want a committed love relationship with the person, you would do well to add the other visualizations into the mix.</p>
	<p>The intelligent rs-er will tailor their sessions according to what stage they are at in their imaginary "relationship". It is foolish to jump straight into full-blown imaginary sex scenes with the person even if sex is all you want from them. For the obvious reasons, you most likely wouldn't immediately go up and grope a person in real life, and so you would be wise to avoid it in your imaginary world also. To do so would be going too far, too fast, which would slow your progress and could ultimately cause the target to try to get away from you. Treat your fantasy relationship in exactly the same way you would a real life one by building it up gradually and there will be less likelihood of them getting overwhelmed by your mind work.</p>
	<p>In addition to the above points, you may want to consider the general nature of the target, if you have some idea of what it is like. A quiet, introverted person would perhaps need a different kind of session to an extrovert, and so on.</p>
	<p><strong>1. Getting Relaxed</strong></p>
	<p>RS works if our minds are anywhere between the alpha and the theta state when we do a session (check the "Brainwave States" guide at the end of this post).</p>
	<p>A lot of people are unsure about whether they are in alpha or not and take great pains to try and get into the state using binaural beats, relaxation recordings, and so on. But alpha is a condition we enter into quite automatically every time we begin daydreaming, imagining, or using creative visualization of any kind. Therefore you don't really need to bother spending 10 or 15 minutes getting into alpha with binaural beats before beginning the seduction part of the session unless you want to. Just as effective would be to simply settle down in a quiet, comfortable spot where you won't be disturbed, take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, and imagine yourself in whatever scene that appeals to you: say, walking along a path to the target's front door, entering their home, climbing the stairs, and walking into their bedroom, where you will find them. You don't need to actually know what their home or bedroom looks like in real life. Using your imagination to make something up will work perfectly well, but try to keep to the same scene each time. That way the mind will automatically understand that is about to get into rs and will shift accordingly to the task at hand. Once you have found your target, your mind will have drifted into alpha and you can begin your session.</p>
	<p>Although rs is at its most effective while the rs-er is in deep theta, being in control and not falling asleep is a fairly tricky thing to master (although you will eventually master it quite naturally, if you continue to practice rs), but rest assured, for the time being your sessions will be effective enough at the alpha level, which is much easier to get into.<p>
	<p><strong>2. Sexual RS</strong></p>
	<p>This part of the session is dedicated to psychic sexual interaction with your target.  It can be as raunchy or as tame as you wish it to be, but the general idea is to mentally caress them in an erotic manner, concentrating in particular on their erogenous zones. Amargi Hillier covers this in his book "Mind Power Seduction Manual", but in a nutshell, you need to imagine the feel of the person as you caress them. Imagine the temperature and texture of their skin - how they shiver as you run your fingers down the nape of their neck, how their muscles contract as you slide your hands up over their legs, and so on. You can practice this outside of your sessions by running your hands over a part of your own body, or running your fingers sensually through your hair and then closing your eyes and trying to duplicate the feeling in your imagination only.</p>
	<p>So in your imagination, softly kiss the nape of their neck, languidly run your fingers through their hair, nibble their earlobe, softly stroke their inner wrists, and so on. You can progress to caressing, licking, and stimulating the more obvious sexual areas, such as nipples, genitals, etc, but take care not to rush in to this. Build up the sexy feelings in your target first over time so that in their subconscious mind they begin to crave you. Then strike while the iron is so hot that you send them right over the edge with their passion. Try to spend at least thirty seconds to three minutes on each area you are focusing on before moving on to another. While caressing the target, try to imagine warmth flowing from your hands onto their skin. You might want to imagine this flow as orange or reddish light. As you continue, you will find that your hands can actually heat up for real quite a lot. What you are doing is creating an energy flow which with practice will be felt by the person.</p>
	<p>In real life the target will often be feeling at least some of what you are visualizing, so imagine the person getting extremely aroused by your caresses. See the desire for you in their eyes. Sense the sexual charge crackling in the air. Feel them surrender to your touch, and so on.</p>
	<p>In addition to the caresses, you can include any other sexual act that takes your fancy. The same rules about imagining the touch sensation apply here as well: feel the warmth of the target's body against yours. Feel their heartbeat. Feel penetration. Repeating that identical scenario over several sessions will often cause the target to start fantasizing along the same lines.</p>
	<p>Imagined sexual intercourse can be a part of sexual rs, but it can also be included in love rs as well, depending on the type of experience you are wishing to create. If you are imagining a lot of hot sexual positions, it will obviously tend to fit more in the sexual rs category. However, if you are "making love" in a more tender and emotional way, then your scenario will be more fitting in the love rs category. The two styles can be included in the same session, of course, if you would like them to be.</p>
	<p><strong>3. Love RS</strong></p>
	<p>This part of the session is all about emotions. Just as the sexual rs was intended to make the target horny for you, you are now going to make them feel love for you. Your scenario should focus on cuddling, kissing, hand-holding, gazing into each other's eyes, tenderness, adoration, and so on.You can greatly enhance the effect on your target by seeing them in front of you and "sending" feelings of intense romantic love from your heart into their heart, plus a "butterflies in the stomach" sensation from your solar plexus into theirs. Imagine all of these as waves of emotion flowing out from you to them like electric water from a hose and really build up the intensity. See them reacting with love to the feelings you are sending them; hear them saying the words to you that you want to hear. Keep it intense. As with the sexual form of RS, feel it to be real, as if it is actually happening in this very moment.</p>
	<p><strong>4. Soulmate Scenario</strong></p>
	<p>This is optional, and only requires and extra five or ten minutes, but you will add a LOT of power to your sessions if you finish them off with an imaginal scene that depicts you and your target enjoying other aspects of your relationship together. This could be having a candle-lit meal out, sitting together in the lounge chatting, strolling somewhere hand-in-hand, or whatever scene you would like to actually experience with the target in real life. Whatever you visualize, be sure to emphasize how perfectly you click with this person, how in tune you are with each other on every level and about every subject, and how you hang on to each other's every word. Hear you both finishing each other's sentences. Feel your target's touch on your arm as you laugh together. Smell the freshly cut grass as you stroll hand in hand in a park. Taste the strong coffee as you sit totally absorbed in each other at a street café. See in their eyes how they adore you and your company. Use all of your senses. Our thoughts create our reality, and this form of creative visualization will attract this same kind of relationship with the person in your real life, making it extra special.</p>
	<p><strong>Some Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>The following examples are a rough guide only, but they will give you some idea of what a structured RS session might look like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>A session to attract a purely sexual relationship with your target might look something like this:<br/><i>5 minutes of scenario building eg, being out on a date that leads to a sexual encounter with the target (optional) + 15-45 minutes of "sexual rs", including erotic touching, oral sex, sexual intercourse, etc.</i></p></li>
		<li><p>A session to attract a romantic/love relationship with your target could be like this:<br/><i>15 minutes of "sexual rs"+15-20 minutes of "love rs"+ 5 -10 minutes of "soulmate scenario"(optional).</i></p></li>
		<li><p>An initial session where sexual desire hasn't built up yet might look something like this:<br/><i>15 minutes of "soulmate secenario"+ 10 minutes of "love rs"+ 5-10 minutes of "sexual rs" (limited at first to hand-holding, stroking the inner wrists, hair stroking, etc).</i></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>After the Session</strong></p>
	<p>Once the session is over, turn your attention to something else. Get on with your life, but try to maintain a feeling of inner knowing that this experience with the person really did happen (because between the two of you, on a telepathic level, it did). Maintaining that state will help to push it into your reality.</p>
	<p><strong>Brainwave States</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Beta - Fully awake; active thinking and processing; busy; concentration</li>
		<li>Alpha - A daydreaming-like state. Relaxed but still alert</li>
		<li>Theta - Very deep relaxation, bordering on sleep, REM sleep</li>
		<li>Delta -  Deep, dreamless sleep</li>

	In this third part of the series on remote seduction (rs) I will be covering some observations about remote seduction and what to expect with it so that success can be attained. Remote seduction has grown increasingly popular over the past years as a method to attract a romantic or sexual partner, to get an ex to return, or to rev up the passion in an existing relationship. It is a specialized form of telepathy that plants feelings of love and/or sexual desire into the mind and body of the specific person you have your eye on (known as the "target"). Depending on the skill of the rs-er, results can vary from astonishingly successful to frustratingly hit-and-miss. It is the hit-and-miss that we wish to avoid here.</p>
	<p>How to use the actual technique is covered in other posts, but for now I am assuming that the reader has at least some idea of the basic method of RS and what it entails. Here we will concentrate solely on learning how understand the process of using psychic influence to make a person fall in love with you over the long haul, and how to ride any initial storms so that results can be achieved.</p>
	<p>The first thing to remember is that while there can be an instant reaction, the effects of rs can take some time to become apparent. This may be partly because of a phenomenon known as "latency", or time-delay (where the effects are felt hours or even days after the session was actually carried out) - and partly because a psychic link, or bond, must be established between rs-er and target. When one considers that telepathy is known to be more dramatic between people who are in a close relationship (lovers, close friends, siblings, etc), it makes sense that a similar psychic bond has to be be set in place between the rs-er and the target. All too often, an rs-er will write off their attempts as a failure because at first they don't notice any appreciable reaction. They will question their ability, which will either cause them to give up, or else it will contaminate their future sessions with doubt (doubt is the rs-er's deadly enemy). But keep in mind that the moment you begin communicating with a person telepathically then you become entangled with them and so even when at first there seems to be little evidence of your rs working, things are often going on in the background that will start to come to light once that entanglement increases.  This can be achieved through regular sessions that continue over the following days and weeks. In addition the rs-er needs to sit back and adopt a relaxed, confident attitude where they have faith in the process and do not question it. It is not uncommon for subtle signs that the influence is working to be detectable after a fortnight or so, becoming more evident during the weeks that follow.  The influence gradually accumulates, until one day it dawns on the targer that they are having strong feelings for the rs-er - often to the point of feeling genuinely infatuated or in love.</p>
	<p> Another thing to consider is that initially the effects of RS tend to be temporary. In the first few weeks it will be that the target appears on occasion to be very attracted to the rs-er, but then the feelings fizzle out after a few hours, causing the target to lose interest again. As disheartening as this can be for the rs-er, it is helpful to remember that this phase is just temporary. With the passage of time those feelings start to linger for longer, until finally they are more or less constant. The target may feel confused by, or even scared at the intensity of their emotions at this point and may try to resist what is happening. They may tell themselves that it's just a silly phase that will fade out in time, and so on. They may even vent their frustration at the rs-er and/or try to get reactions, put up walls, or try to avoid them for a while . This kind of behaviour can seem like a setback, but again this is all a question of being patient and persisting with the sessions regardless. After two or three months have elapsed the effects will tend to gradually set in and become permanent. There will be less confusion, less hot and cold behaviour, and the target will finally begin to settle in to the idea (it will always feel as if it is their own idea) that they have intense feelings for the rs-er. If the sessions are kept up the attraction will continue to increase - often to the point where the target falls very deeply in love. As covered in a previous post: if the sessions are discontinued at this point, those accumulated feelings will not disappear. Rather, they will either continue to be experienced or they will become like a dormant volcano, rising up with full force if ever they are in contact with the rs-er, or if the sessions are resumed.</p>
	<p>So to sum up: give your remote seduction at least one to three months to gel; keep up with the sessions, and don't give up when things look like things aren't going as smoothly as you had hoped. Sometimes we can feel like we are taking three steps forward and two steps back - or even no steps at all. But in fact there are usually things going on below the surface which will take form later on in ways that can be quite staggering.</p>

	Much of the success with remote seduction depends on psychic power and the rs-er's ability to connect with the target. Without those two factors, the thought waves will be weak or may even bypass the target altogether.</p>
	<p>We are all made of energy and we all posess psychic power to varying degrees. There are those who are naturally gifted from birth and don't  need to work very hard to get their thoughts to affect another person, there are those who experience moderate reactions from their target, and there are others who rarely - if ever - manage to affect their target at all.  But our capacity to send thought waves is very much like a muscle: in order for it to work at peak efficiency we must train it on an ongoing and regular basis.</p>
	<p>Remote seduction relies on a number of skills: the ability to send touch sensations to another person; the ability to affect the target emotionally; the ability to send specific thoughts to the target; the ability to vividly imagine, using all of the senses (sight, touch, taste, smell, hearing); the ability to keep the mind focused on the session.</p>
	<p>The more adept you are in any of the above areas, the more likely you will be to have results with your rs. Training the mind takes a little discipline, but the benefits are considerable. Here are a few steps you can take to improve your overall skill:</p>
	<p><strong>Practice Regularly</strong></p>
	<p>Simply by adhering to a regular routine of two sessions a day, five to six times a week, will strengthen your psychic "muscles" quite naturally, over time, making you not only better at rs, but you may find you are having other psychic experiences (sharper intuition, lucid dreaming, etc) as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Meditate</strong></p>
	<p>If we can't focus our mind on imaginal scenes without it continually wandering off then we will not be getting the most out of our sessions. In order to create impact on the target we have to channel all of our energy and focus into what we are doing. Meditation is possibly the number one ally to remote seduction, and should be done for at least fifteen minutes daily. It can gradually teach us to quiet that chattering monkey of the mind so that we experience our seductive scenes vividly, with few interruptions.</p>
	<p><strong>Practice Telepathy and Other ESP Skills</strong></p>
	<p>Given that rs is a form of telepathy, it makes sense to develop these skills by practicing with general mind-to-mind exercises. Find a friend who is open minded enough to accept the possibility that telepathy exists (avoid practicing with someone who is skeptical, since their lack of belief will do your blossoming skills more harm than good), learn the basics and then practice sending each other mental images, feelings, and ideas. Or send somebody you know but haven't talked to in a long time a mental message to contact you. Don't overlook other forms of ESP (extrasensory perception) either, since they are all related to rs in their way. Strengthening your skill in one area will naturally increase your ability in all of the others. Remote viewing, telekinesis, remote influence, and so on, are some areas to explore.</p>
	<p><strong>Practice Visualization in First Person</strong></p>
	<p>Spend some time each day picturing yourself in some imaginary scene where you are in first person view. For example, you could imagine yourself in a jungle, walking through the trees. What would you see? What would you smell? Would there be the sound of wildlife in the jungle? Would it be hot? Humid? Dappled with shade? What would a mango taste like if you picked it off a tree, then peeled it and ate it? What would its aroma be? What would its colour and texture be?  Imagine some scene - any scene you like - and make feel as if you are really there. Really live out that scene for the 5 or ten minutes you have chosen for your visualization.</p>
	<p><strong>Pay Special Attention to the Feeling of Touch</strong></p>
	<p>Any form of remote seduction where you are attempting to sexually arouse the target will require the ability to send out the feeling of touch. Have practice sessions where you imagine heat/energy radiating out of your hands as you caress your own skin. Run your hand over your skin and then close your eyes and try to remember what it all felt like in your mind when you really touched these things. Concentrate on the memory of the touch. What were the textures and temperatures? Was the skin hairy or smooth? Now (in first person view) imagine you are actually feeling whatever it was that your real hands and fingers had been touching previously. Imagine a trail of energy flowing from your hands onto the skin, if that helps.</p>
	<p><strong>Practice Working With Heart Energy and the Chakras</strong></p>
	<p>Learn as much as you can about the chakras and their different roles in the body, and then start to use them in your rs sessions. These wheels of energy play an important role not only in how we send out our own energy, but how it is received by the target as well. A detailed description of the chakras and how you can work with them is beyond the scope of this  post, but for now keep in mind that you can radiate energy from any chosen chakra to the target's corresponding chakra, depending on what effect you wish to create in the person. If for example I want to create feelings of sexual desire, I will radiate that feeling from my sacral chakra to the target's, via a stream of bright orange energy. I will see that energy hitting the target's sacral chakra, and I will imagine that feeling spreading over their body as intense sexual pleasure which causes them to react.</p>
	<p>All chakras are capable of sending energy and receiving it, but some are better at sending energy than others. Among the best at sending energy are the third eye, the solar plexus chakra, the sacral chakra, and especially, the heart.</p>
	<p>The heart has power that every rs-er should be aware of and practice with. According to the HMI-Institut HeartMath (https://www.heartmath.org/), this organ generates the largest electromagnetic field in the body - far more so than the brain. To send heart energy, concentrate on your heart chakra and feel it filling up with as much love as you possibly can. Imagine it building up with energy and then when you feel that you have reached saturation point, allow that energy to flow to a person you love or care about.  You can do this anywhere, at any time.</p>

	Once you have obtained a degree of skill with remote seduction you may wish to progress to greater heights and experiment with more advanced techniques. One such method involves mentally transferring yourself into your target, or "stepping in".</p>
	<p>Stepping in, if you can get the hang of it, is a powerful technique that combines psychic influence, remote viewing, and psychic seduction all in one. Like all forms of remote seduction, it is controversial - only this time somewhat more so, since you are literally getting into the driving seat of the target's (the person's) mind and are either tapping into their emotional state, or directing their thoughts, feelings and actions so that they think, feel and do whatever you want them to.</p>
	<p>Transferring yourself into your target's psyche effectively means that you temporarily become them. You sense thoughts and feelings from their point of view; you look down and see their hands, legs and feet rather than yours. And if you want, you can plant actual feelings of desire for you into them and physical sensations into their body. The technique requires an open mind and is not for the faint-hearted.</p>
	<p>Stepping in can be especially helpful if:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your existing rs sessions feel like they have gone stale and need a boost.</li>
		<li>You would like to get some idea about what the target is really feeling at any given time.</li>
		<li>You want to influence the person to act in a particular way, according to your wishes.</li>
		<li>You want to make the person experience a very specific kind of sexual desire or pleasure (perhaps things that they normally don't like or feel are "taboo"), or to feel certain emotions toward you.</li>
		<li>You want to experiment with new techniques and reach new levels of psychic skill.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Because of its intense nature, stepping-in can be mentally draining - often more so than regular remote seduction. Some people like to use it as an occasional substitute for their normal sessions, while others prefer it as their main technique. Whatever the case, don't be surprised if you need to take things easy following a session.</p>
	<p>The following is a basic outline of a step-in method specifically geared to make your target feel sexual attraction and/or love for you. Once mastered, the technique can be adapted in any way you wish:</p>
	<p><strong>Step-in Method</strong></p>
	<p><strong>1</strong> - Get relaxed in whatever way you feel best with. Listening to binaural beats or new age music aimed at entering the theta brain-wave state can give you a particularly vivid experience - provided you can avoid falling asleep. If not, simply take yourself into alpha (a daydream-like state) and work from there. The more deeply relaxed you are the better.</p>
	<p><strong>2</strong>- Now that you are relaxed, tell yourself that on the count of three you will transport yourself to the destination of your target. If you are familiar with the original 60s Star Trek tv series, you could imagine "beaming yourself" instantly to the desired place in a similar way. If you don't know where the target happens to be in that moment, you will have to guess. For example, if you feel the target might be in her/his bedroom at that moment, aim to project yourself there. Don't worry too much about making a wrong guess because even then the technique will be effective.</p>
	<p><strong>3</strong> - Having mentally projected yourself into your target's surroundings, take a few moments to glance around the room. Observe any details that emerge for you.  It isn't uncommon to have remote-viewing-like experiences where you pick up certain details of the person's environment that turn out later to have some accuracy. You may get a sense of it being day or night, light or shadowy, hot or cold or humid, etc. You may get vague impressions of furniture or objects in the room, a particular atmosphere, specific sounds or aromas.</p>
	<p><strong>4</strong> - See the target as vividly as possible standing about half a meter (just over a foot) away with their back to you. Look at him/her for a moment, and then in your mind see and feel yourself mentally "stepping in" to them. You can imagine yourself doing this in much the same way you might step into a jumpsuit, boiler suit or other kind of all-in one clothing. Once you are inside the target's mind, glance down and notice that you have their hands and lower body rather than your own, and are thinking from their point of view, seeing the world from their eyes, etc. If there is a mirror and you look into it, you will see the target's image staring back at you. At this point a few impressions about the person's inner thoughts and state of mind might start to emerge. You are tapping in to what is going on for them and how they actually may be feeling in this moment, so the key is to observe and be aware. With practice, it will be possible to detect subtle differences in how you feel that indicate you are now "them" and not "you".</p>
	<p><strong>5</strong> - Now that you are your target, you can gently begin to influence them: to plant specific feelings for you into their mind. See "yourself" standing there in front of the target. Build up gradually - perhaps planting feelings of fascination and attraction at first in the person that increase over the session (or over a number of sessions) to the point of being clearly romantic and sexual. Imagine all this desire is for the image of "you" that is standing there. Make the target take "you" in their arms, gaze into each other's eyes, hold hands, exchange words of love. And/or exchange erotic, suggestive words if that's what you prefer.</p>
	<p><strong>6</strong> - The next step can take a bit of getting used to, but (still mentally inside your target) make love to "you" in whatever way you choose. Make it feel authentic and really act out the role of your target feeling crazy with passion for you. Needless to say, this experience of pretending to be your target making love to you can feel quite strange at first. If your target is a man and you are a woman you may start to experience the kind of sexual arousal that feels decidedly "male" in nature: you may feel "hard". If your target is a woman and you are a man, you may feel yourself getting "wet", and so on. If you are especially creative you can even bring on the feeling of orgasm in your target as they make love to you. Given that orgasm during sex strengthens the bond between two people, mastering such a skill during your step-in sessions would be especially powerful and can take the progress you have been making with your target to a whole new level.</p>
	<p><strong>7</strong> - Once you feel ready to stop, it will be time to "step out" or "float out" of the target. Some people naturally feel themselves floating out spontaneously, with their mind suddenly finding itself back in its real surroundings, and so on. Whatever happens, don't aim to stay inside the target's mind for more than 15 or 20 minutes per session, because at that point the target will start to naturally push you out. You can end the session simply imagining stepping or floating out of the target and it will be done. Once you feel you are out, take a look briefly at your surroundings for a few moments and then come back to your waking reality.</p>
	<p><strong>How the target will react</strong></p>
	<p>Often the target will react in much the same way as with other forms of remote seduction, but it is not uncommon for them to be overwhelmed initially. They may find themselves trying to deal with heavy emotions and internal conflict as they struggle to come to grips with it all. Resistance (the urge to flee from the target or to fight the feelings) is common at first. However, if sessions (either step-in or other forms of rs) are kept up this behaviour will be temporary and is in fact a sign that the target is getting attached to the rs-er, and that the influence is working.</p>
	<p><strong>Taking a real physical step into your target.</strong></p>
	<p>In the pdf book "Psychic Seduction Secrets", the author suggests imagining the target standing in front of you and taking a real physical step forward in the same moment you imagine stepping into him/her.  You may wish to turn to that book, if you can obtain a copy of it, in order to master the technique. As with the above method, it can be super-effective.</p>

	<p><img src="https://badgirlsbible.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/seduction-techniques.jpg" alt="RS">
	It is not uncommon when using remote seduction to encounter resistance from the target. Symptoms may include them getting over-shy and clamming up whenever you're around, showing cold or hostile behavior towards you, trying to avoid you, putting up "walls", hot and cold behaviour, etc. They may also feel (and look) tired, since RS can disturb their sleep patterns and drain them of energy.</p>
	<p>Another thing that can happen once you have achieved a certain amount of success with the person (if you have begun spending time with them, for example) is that the hot and cold behaviour increases to the point where they attempt to provoke disagreements with you or try very hard to deny their true feelings. They may show intense passion one moment, only to avoid you the next. They may mention feeling "scared" or "confused" about their feelings. This can be especially true once they have actually gotten romantic with you. The strong feelings can overwhelm or even frustrate them for a while. For example, if the target has always been the kind to jump from lover to lover without getting completely attached, then it may come as a shock to them when they find themselves intensely drawn to just one person at the exclusion of all others and are fantasizing about them all day. At first they may try to fight this behaviour that is so foreign to them. But rest assured that the pull of RS, if it has been carried out skillfully enough, is extremely strong. An rs-er who successfully attracts their target will tend to have the advantage over someone who simply attracted their lover in the regular (non-psychic) way. This is because RS amplifies the feelings of love and/or attraction towards the rs-er and also creates and strengthens the telepathic bond to the point where no one else can really compare.</p>
	<p>As frustrating or upsetting as resistance can be, it is actually a sign that your RS is working and should never be dismissed as failure. It is an indication that the target's feelings are getting serious, and the worst that can happen is that it delays the results somewhat.  But of course the rs-er should not be concerning themselves with time anyway, since that will also mess with the process.</p>
	<p><strong>How to deal with resistance, if it happens:</strong></p>
	<p>The most important thing to do when resistance comes up is to carry on with your sessions regardless and to not fall into the trap of giving up in defeat. Remember that the resistance is a sign that the RS is affecting the target and giving them feelings for you that they will ultimately surrender to if the sessions are kept up. Having said that, depending on how the target is reacting and what kind of personality they have, you may need to review your sessions and modify them, using one or more of the following techniques:</p>
	<p><strong>1</strong> - If you have been getting very sexual or imagined the target getting over-emotional in your visualizations, then you may be going too far too fast. Turn down the intensity a bit. Begin with hand holding, etc, and work back up to more intimate seduction in stages.</p>
	<p><strong>2</strong> - Use "reverse seduction" where rather than you seducing them, you turn the tables and imagine them wanting to seduce you. Imagine them in the role of the "persuer" with you being the one who is being persued. This particular tactic, if carried on for several days, can be very effective because it plants feelings of desire and the need to conquer in the mind of the target. However, avoid scenes where the target is on their knees to you, crying, begging and pleading for you to be with them. Too many people, upset at being rejected by their target in real life, attempt to control them this way in their sessions. This kind of method is sure to backfire, since forcing someone into such behaviour - even in the 4D world - will repel rather than attract simply because it is so negative and degrading.</p>
	<p><strong>3</strong> - Increase your sessions in intensity, duration, or frequency.</p>
	<p><strong>4</strong> - Use the start-stop method: take a break of a couple of days from your sessions and then launch into them again with full force. This will be a shock to the target's system, since their defenses will be down after the break.</p>
	<p><strong>5</strong> - If the target has actively tried to get away from you or shown signs of not wanting to be around you, give them space, avoid contacting them, and work on things behind the scenes with your sessions.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, don't just assume you will have to face resistance. It may happen or it may not, but don't spend time worrying or believing it into existance. Assume that even if it does occur, your RS will always work at some point or other.</p>

	Remote Seduction (RS) can be effective, but it is not enough to just do the sessions if deep down you aren't convinced that they will really work. In order for your efforts to have true impact, you need to cultivate the feeling - the deep knowing -  that the person is really crazy for you. The following is a method that on the surface appears so basic that it's almost ridiculous, but don't confuse its simplicity with ineffectiveness. In truth this method is powerful and can really enhance your progress with psychic seduction - so powerful that it can even work in the absence of RS.</p>
	<p>Here is what you do: think intensely and lovingly of your target at different moments throughout the day. In particular, imagine them telling you something  that you would particularly like to hear from them (something that implies your goal has been reached), hear the tone of their voice and see their facial expressions, feel their passionate energy towards you, etc. Just live in it momentarily and enjoy the feeling of it. Now loop it over and over in your mind while you are doing mundane tasks during the day, when you wake up, while you are showering, travelling to work, taking a walk, etc. Just keep on generating loving thoughts about them, hearing them say the desired words to you, and your response to it.</p>
	<p>And that's it! That is literally all you have to do.</p>
	<p>Our thoughts about other people are felt by them on a subliminal level. I have a friend who contacts me from time to time out of the blue, saying how she really misses me. Whenever she does this, I will begin thinking of her strongly in the days that lead up to the contact. I will start missing her and feeling the urge to reach out. So not only do I start thinking of her when she is thinking of me, but the content of my thoughts always matches hers as well. It is truly amazing how human beings can have this kind of silent communication, but it is really an innate ability that we all have. The more you make this method part of your daily routine, the more your thoughts will enter your target's mind, and the greater the link between you will become.</p>
	<p>If, for example, you imagine the target saying: "I can't get you out of my mind; you're all I care about", and you repeat this little scene in your head at random points during the day (being sure to actually feel it as well), not only will you start to convince yourself that it is really true, but the person gradually start to conform to what you are imagining. Don't be at all surprised if some day down the line they actually repeat the exact words back to you as well.</p>
	<p>You are working on the target with telepathy, but you are also manipulating your reality to suit your wishes. What we believe is what ultimately shapes our real life experiences. If we think someone really adores us, they generally do; if we think that a person dislikes us or mistrusts us or cheats on us, they will tend to reflect that view in our reality. So start cultivating the view (regardless of whether you feel it is true or possible right now) that the person loves and/or desires you over all others. Hold this feeling as much as possible whenever the target pops into your mind.  Keep it up and in time it will become so.</p>
	<p>Above all, avoid having mental arguments with the person. If your target is an ex or someone who you know and have had negative experiences with in the past, then don't relive old fights with them in your mind over and over. Avoid imagining what you would have said or done in order to make them see how wrong they were or how much they hurt you, since doing so will only serve to add more energy to those past situations, making them more likely to repeat themselves in the future. Considering that our thoughts do get through to other people, the last thing you want is for your negative thoughts about what went wrong with your relationship to be getting through to your target's mind as well. Do the opposite and imagine them being the way you really want them to be with you!</p>
	<p>As mentioned earlier, you can use this technique as a supplement to remote seduction, or you can use it entirely on its own.</p>

	In this post we will be concentrating on how to use a photo of your target for remote seduction & remote influence. Using a photographic image has long been a magick staple, partly because it creates a stronger link between the practitioner and the target. In a similar way, using a photo can be incorporated into remote seduction sessions. Anyone can use the technique, but it is especially helpful for those who haven't yet trained their minds to visualize clearly and need a quick way to fuel the imagination.</p>
	<p>The photo serves as a guideline for your mental fantasies and you will be doing your sessions open-eyed, with the image in front of you. Other than that, there is not much difference between this technique and the regular kinds of RS/RI outlined in previous posts devoted to the topic.</p>
	<p>You will need a photo of the target that clearly shows their face (one pulled off the internet will do) and has no other people in it.  If it is impossible to get a picture that shows that person only, then you must erase everyone else - either by using photo editing software - or by simply cutting the other images out with scissors or blocking with a marker pen. The image doesn't have to be life-size and it doesn't need to include the person's full body (you can effectively make that up in your mind as you visualize), but the photo must be sufficiently clear for you to see their facial features, particularly their eyes.</p>
	<p><strong>For Remote Seduction</strong></p>
	<p>If it is a physical photo, one option is to stick it on the wall directly in front of you. Or you can simply get hold of a photo (even one on your phone or laptop), then find a comfortable space where you won't be disturbed and once relaxed, begin mentally stroking and fondling the person. Rather than simply acting it all out in your mind as yoou would with regular RS, you physically move your hands as if you are really doing what you are imagining. Lift your hand, and without actually touching the photo, go through all the motions of caressing your target's face and body. You are literally caressing the space in front of you, but the session should be so vivid that it literally feels like your target's features beneath your fingertips. Look into their eyes, whisper seductively into their ears and have them say the things that you want to hear from them. See their reactions. And that's it! The technique is extremely simple, but using these real actions instead of  simply visualizing them will make the experience feel especially authentic and satisfying.</p>
	<p><strong>For Remote Influence</strong></p>
	<p>If you are attempting to influence a target, simply go through the normal steps of any particular technique you are using, but this time do it with eyes open and looking at the person's photograph. Concentrate especially on their eyes, their third eye, and if you are going whisper a command, remember to lean forward and actually say what you want to say into their ears.</p>

	This post is going to be a short one, but I have found the following method to be a highly effective way of using telepathy:</p>
	<p>If you want to make someone think of you and contact you, then spend the next few days thinking about them intensely and fairly often. Choose someone you have had a reasonably good relationship with in the past (such as a family member or a friend or ex lover). Read old letters, remember old times, old conversations, listen to music that reminds you of them, look at old photos, and so on. Just occupy your mind with the person as much as possible. Immerse yourself in this for two or three days.</p>
	<p>When you do this, it's quite possible that the person will reach out in the days that follow, saying that they were thinking of you a great deal and had the urge to make contact.</p>
	<p>Try it. Practice with it, and see whether it works for you.</p>

	Communicating telepathically with somebody is an innate ability that we are all blessed with. There are still tribes in some parts of the world who deliberately use telepathy as a natural part of their everyday life, and most of us can remember a time when we thought of someone and then that person contacted us, or we missed someone and the next time we encountered each other, that person mentioned having the same feelings. Or you can be talking to a friend and they finish your sentence. The following method is basic and easy to master, but extremely effective, particularly if you want somebody to feel what you wish them to feel. It can reach the target person whether they are right beside you or on the other side of the world. The more you practice this skill, the better and more consistent your results will be:</p>
	<p>For this exercise, it is best to choose a target who you know reasonably well and preferably have a close relationship with, such as a relative, lover, or close friend.</p>
	<p>Choose a time when you are free from any stress or tension. Before beginning the session, it's important to have decided what feeling, words, mental image (or a combination of all three) that you wish to get across. Spend a little time planning and keep it short, simple, and to the point. The target's mind will not be able to process elaborate messages or images.</p>
	<p>If possible, have ready a photograph of the person (either a printed photo or one you have pulled out of the internet, etc), preferably one where you can look clearly into their eyes. This step is optional, but it will provide a sympathetic link between the two of you and will increase the connection.</p>
	<p>When you practice telepathy, it is helpful to avoid being around things that could rob you of some of your psychic energy or interfere with the connection. Work in an uncluttered, dust free environment where you will not be disturbed. Turn off all electric appliances (phone, television, computer, and so on), and find a restful place to relax.</p>
	<p>If you can manage to do this session when the target is asleep, then so much the better (3am or in the half hour before you think the target will wake up are the absolute best times), but if this is not possible, try to arrange for a time when you think they might be fairly relaxed.</p>
	<p>Once you have settled down, spend a few minutes looking at the photograph you have chosen. Gaze deeply into the target's eyes and think a little about the message you would like to send them.</p>
	<p>Now close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and relax in any way that feels best. Some people like to count down from 10-1, while others feel best by imagining themselves stepping slowly down a flight of stairs. Choose whatever feels right for you.</p>
	<p>Having relaxed fully, imagine the target in front of you. The initial step of looking at the photograph will hopefully have etched it into your mind's eye, giving a mental image that is clearer than normal. If not, it doesn't matter: just having a "sense" of them being there will be enough to psychically summon them to you. Look into the person's eyes and in your mind, repeat their name a few times. Speak clearly and with authority, as if grabbing their attention. Try to focus on a line of energy flowing from your solar plexus into theirs. At this point you may feel some sensations that indicate you have connected. You may experience a sinking sensation that feels like you are going down in an elevator or an inner "jolt". You may feel energy or pressure building in your third eye. You may feel that everything in the outside world has faded into the background, and there is only you and that person. Everybody is different, but pay attention for signs that tell you intuitively that a psychic link has been established.</p>
	<p>At this point you can send the target your psychic message. If you are sending words or a simple mental image, think about them clearly for a few moments, then imagine them travelling through an imaginary tube from your third eye into their third eye, or if you prefer, from your eyes into their eyes. With words, try to feel the emotion of what you are saying as you send them.</p>
	<p>An open minded, playful attitude is essential here. Try not to get caught up in worrying about whether it will work or whether it is possible, and so on. Assume that you have connected with the person and that you are able to communicate with them. Just let go and allow it to happen.</p>
	<p>Of all forms of telepathic communication, emotions are perhaps the easiest and most effective to send. They can also be the most powerful since strong emotions (love, desire, longing, anger, etc) are packed with energy and they can make the target feel what you feel. You can send them instead of or in addition to the words or images you are broadcasting. If you are wishing to send a feeling, allow it to build up in your heart first for a few moments until you feel it as strongly as possible. Really immerse yourself in the emotion and then fire it in a stream of energy into the target's heart and solar plexus areas. See it flowing out like water from a hose. Imagine him or her being flooded with the emotion and see them reacting to it in the way that you wish.</p>
	<p>Keep this up for as long as you like. A few minutes is usually enough, after which you may sense a dip in the energy, or you might begin to feel yourself disconnecting with the target. This will be a signal that you have done all you can and that it is time for you to stop. With practice you will come to intuitively know when that point is.</p>
	<p>Once you feel satisfied with what you have sent, you can end the session. You can communicate with the person this way just the once, or you may wish to repeat it once or twice daily, until you feel that they have totally absorbed the message.</p>

	Once you have deliberately used telepathy, remote seduction or remote influence over a period of time you will discover that you become more sensitive to other people's incoming thought waves. You will start to sense whether an emotion, a sensation or a thought that enters your mind naturally originated from you, or whether it is being transmitted from outside of you: from another person. For example we may identify a thought or feeling as something that is not of our usual pattern, we could suddenly begin a train of thought that we don't normally dwell on. Or the thought or feeling springs up out of nowhere and for no apparent reason.  You may be engrossed in something that has your full attention when you find yourself distracted by a sudden barrage of thoughts that start to crowd out what you were originally thinking.</p>
	<p>All of the above are clues that you are picking up someone else's thoughts or their psychic waves. But can you actually identify who is sending those thoughts to you? The answer is yes, sometimes.</p>
	<p>With practice and awareness, you can learn to either be very sure - or at least to have some inkling - of who the thoughts could be coming from. If you have no idea who the sender is, try to go within and ask your higher self. Often a name or thought will come up, and the very first one will probably be accurate. Don't try to force the answer because the mind will just interfere and come up with inaccurate information. But if you remain open to the information floating up, sometimes you will get a sense of who the sender is.  Telepathy or psychic influence can take place between any two people, but it usually occurs most dramatically between those who are close to each other (a relative, spouse, close friend, or a lover), or to people who always seem to be on the same page as each other, such as a good friend. One clue is that the person will unexpectedly pop up in your mind, right out of the blue, and for no apparent reason. For example, they may appear in your thoughts out of nowhere, along with the image or words that they are transmitting. Or you may be hit with some kind of emotion which you associate with the person. You might suddenly miss them. You could feel a wave of love, sexual attraction, longing or worry, for example. I remember one time a friend who I hadn't spoken to in ages suddenly popped up in my mind.  The last time I saw her we had argued and as the thoughts of her flooded in, my mind relived that incident, remembering the things we had said to each other. Later that day, my friend contacted me, and while we were talking she reminded me of the incident and stressed how she wanted to be on good terms again. I had been on her mind intensely before she actually reached out, and I was picking up her strong thoughts in fairly clear detail.</p>
	<p>Just because we are receiving someone's thoughts doesn't automatically mean that we are stuck with them: once we are aware of them, we can choose to accept a thought or reject it. Many people talk about putting on "protective shields" from outside influence, other people's thoughts, and so on.  But in fact, just knowing that the thought is coming from outside of you is usually enough to give you the ability to throw it off. Simply decide to reject the thought/sensation and you will tend to find that it begins to lose its hold on you. On the other hand, you may choose to accept the thought, especially if you have the strong feeling that it is coming from someone close to you. You may want to contact the person if you feel they are in some kind of difficulty, for example.</p>
	<p>Sometimes we can receive someone else's thoughts through physical sensations, rather than through actual words or images in our head. Typically this will be a sensation in one of the main chakra zones: we may experience a sinking feeling in the stomach, a heavy feeling in the heart, a gnawing feeling in the throat, or a charged feeling in the third eye area. All of these feelings may be accompanied with thoughts of the person who is psychically connecting with us.</p>
	<p>Sensing other people's thoughts or seeing flash images of something in your mind that is related to their own thoughts seems to happen more when we are relaxed. For example, sometimes we may be lying in bed or watching tv, and the thoughts will come to us quite clearly. People who are being seduced remotely may become aware of sexual waves and erotic thoughts that appear out of the blue. Recognizing signals that our thoughts are actually coming from other people and not us is a skill that can be aquired with practice and patience. The key is to remain aware and to take note of any patterns that emerge. Once we begin to get the hang of it, it will feel natural to us and increasingly reliable.</p>

	If you've ever studdied the subject of telepathy, psychic influence or remote seduction, chances are you've come across claims that the best times to perform your sessions are while the target (the person you are trying to influence) is asleep. The thinking goes that they will be more receptive to psychic influence during those times simply because their defences are down and they have no way of fighting the thought waves or rationaliziing about them.</p>
	<p>In fact our thought waves are capable of reaching a target at any time of day, whether they are awake or asleep, busy or not. However there are points in the day where the effect appears to have a greater impact. The times when the person is especially receptive to psychic influence are either when they are asleep, or when they are awake but in an "alpha" state (a relaxed, "daydreaming" state), or in a "theta" state ( just bordering on sleep).</p>
	<p>If you attempt to connect with your target while they sleep, there will be no resistance to your thoughts, since his/her ability to fight them is deactivated. Your thoughts will enter their subconcious mind more easily this way. The influence may wake them with thoughts about the particular subject that the influencer wanted to get across, about the sender of the thoughts, or with certain feelings that the sender wished them to experience. If not, when they do finally wake up, they will be affected by the thought waves that were transmitted to them. If the sender has been skillful enough, the target may feel themselves thinking constantly about what they experienced during the night, possibly feeling obsessed with the thoughts, feeling urges to act on them. If they have been remotely influenced or sent a telepathic message, they may have the urge to act on that message. If they have been a target of remote seduction, they may find themselves feeling arousal or attraction to the sender - even if they don't quite know who they are.</p>
	<p><strong>THE WITCHING HOUR</strong></p>
	<p>Possibly the very best time of all to send your thoughts to another person, if you can manage to stay up that late yourself, is at 3:am or the "witching hour". There is something about this hour that makes psychic influence much more potent. In folklore, this hour is associated with supernatural events, but it is also a time of night when most people are in very deep sleep. Thus, they are even more susceptible to psychic influence.</p>
	<p>If the target is riding on a bus, meditating, carrying out a repetitive task (such as sweeping or washing dishes), or watching some mundane television program, they will find themselves being naturally transported to the daydreaming state of alpha. In this case they will still be highly receptive to the broadcasted thought waves. If you are transmitting a specific scene, emotion, thought or sensation from your mind to theirs, they will start experiencing the same thing. Again, depending on the kind of influence that is being carried out, they may feel an urge to obey a command, to contact the person who is connecting with them and/or to experience erotic feelings.</p>
	<p>Conversely, when the target is busy, in the middle of a heated discussion, or stressed out, they will generally be less receptive to psychic influence. During those times they may either get the signals more weakly, or else your thoughts may bypass them altogether. Therefore it is a good idea to avoid those times where you feel your target might be less open to your thought waves. Some people will be quite aware of their target's daily routine and be able to pinpoint when they might be asleep or lounging at home. Others will have no idea of their target's day-to-day activities. In that case they would have to make a rough guess, based on time zones and the daily habits of most people.</p>
	<p>Bear in mind that mind-to-mind communication can (and often does) impact a target in delay. It's as if the sent thought waves are capable of going "on hold" for later transmission, rather in the way that a computer is able to send pre-set reminders to its user at a future time or date. So if you happen to do a session while the person's mind is too busy to receive your thoughts, all may not be lost. Often your influence will reach them later on - even several hours later (and possibly even a couple of days later) - when the mind has had a chance to quieten down.</p>
	<p>All things considered, knowing the best times to influence the target can be used to our advantage in order to create greater impact. However, even if you are unable to do your sessions during an ideal moment in the day, keep in mind that with practice our thoughts can get through to the person - at least to some extent - anyway. Far better to do your sessions during busier times of day - if that is all you can manage - than to do nothing at all.</p>

      </div>
      <div id="collapse15" class="panel-collapse collapse">

	<p><img src="https://badgirlsbible.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/seduction-techniques.jpg" alt="RS">
	Extended remote viewing is a technique that uses extra sensory perception (ESP), where one attempts to "sense" impressions of an unseen remote "target". The remote viewer attempts to gather information about a unknown specific person, object, or site that is hidden from view or a long distance away.  Dismissed by many as "pseudoscience", remote viewers nevertheless have routinely come up with information about their target that has shown to have startling accuracy - so accurate that the CIA have been known in the past to have used "psychic spies" in order to help uncover "sensitive" information (google "Project Stargate" for more info).</p>
	<p>There appear to be no limits as far as distance is concerned. Anyone who has read about the results of  Ingo Swann remote viewing the Moon and Jupiter will appreciate how far the human mind is capable of reaching. It is somehow able to detect unseen things that are in any location in any part of the world, and even out of this world: in other planets or other galaxies.</p>
	<p>The less the remote viewer knows about the target, the better. This is because the mind has a habit of forming impressions of its own and the imagination will just start running wild if it is given a starting point with which to work with. It will begin forming a picture that has little to do with the actual target.</p>
	<p>When you begin a session, information will start flooding in very fast over the first few minutes, and then things will slow down somewhat. This initial flood of images is often what will turn out to be the most accurate.</p>
	<p>The information you get won't always be 100% correct, and there will be occasions when nothing seems to have been detected accurately.  But often you will find that the impressions you detect are something very much along the lines of the target you are viewing. You may experience quick flashes of certain aspects of the target, or the experience of different tastes, textures, sounds or smells - or something about the general atmosphere of a place. Once, during an rv session, my target was a Middle Eastern lantern that had a lot of very elaborate designs carved into the metal. One in particular resembled the shape of a flower, with its round circle surrounded by petals. I picked up a lot of information in my mind, very strongly and very quickly, but rather than get the impression of an actual lantern as a whole, my mind's eye saw these smaller details - the designs, the patterns of the border, and the little ring-like metal handle that was used to carry the lantern with. Another time my target was a tv remote control. Rather than being able to guess exactly what the object was, I sensed a black plastic rectangle with many little raised squares on it that I felt might be multi-coloured (the squares turned out to be the red, green, blue and yellow remote control buttons), plus some kind of metallic interior, which turned out to be the inner workings of the device.</p>
	<p><strong>Extended Remote Viewing : How to Remote View</strong></p>
	<p><strong>1</strong> - Ask a friend or relative (one who you are comfortable with and who will not be skeptical) to select one random object (the "target") that they must not tell you about. Instruct them to place that object on a certain place in the house (for example, on the small table in the kitchen, etc).</p>
	<p><strong>2</strong> - In a seperate room, lie down, turn on a voice-recording device, have a pencil and piece of paper (with something flat to rest the paper on as you write and draw) in your hands, and get very relaxed in whatever way you choose (go into alpha or theta).</p>
	<p><strong>3</strong> - Talking into the voice recorder, begin to describe very quickly the first impressions you have of the target. These impressions will come to you very fast over the first few minutes or so. Do not judge the images or try to analyze them. Just state what you see, describe it vocally and quickly scribble the image down on your paper (this is messy and hard to do when relaxed with your eyes closed, but it it possible).</p>
	<p><strong>4</strong> - Describe the sensory details that emerge: what patterns or shapes do you detect? What is the atmosphere? What are the colours, smells, tastes, textures, temperatures, sounds. Is it rough or smooth? Cold or hot? Is it hard or soft? Is it made from metal, wood or fabric? Is it a living creature or a person? Does it have any kind of taste or distinctive aroma?</p>
	<p><strong>5</strong> - Now tell yourself that on the count of three you will lift up and view the target from up high, as if you were an eagle or other predatory bird that can lift off and stay hovering in the air over its prey. Imagine you have the sharp eyesight of this eagle. Instruct yourself to zoom in on this target object. What are your first impressions? What do you see? Again record your observations into the voice recorder and scribble the images down.</p>
	<p><strong>6</strong> - End the session and now on the other side of your paper draw out more carefully the images of what you saw, based on your recording and the scribbled pictures and notes. Make notes as well, if necessary.</p>
	<p><strong>7</strong> - Now go to find the target and compare it with your drawings and notes. You may be very surprised to find that there are things that you noted down in the sessions that are uncannily like the target. If there is nothing, however, don't worry about it.</p>
	<p><strong>How to Improve Your Skills</strong></p>
	<p>Practice makes perfect: regular sessions will help you to improve your skills, but in addition, learning to perceive surroundings will help.  Do not overdo sessions, however. A session every other day or three times a week is sufficient to start building this skill.</p>
	<p>Spend a while each day looking around the room or outdoor space wherever you happen to be. Take in all the details, including colours, shapes, sounds, smells, textures, temperatures, and so on. In addition, working on any kind of ESP skills (telepathy, telekinesis, etc) will help you to increase your general psychic ability.</p>
	<p>In his book, The Seventh Sense, remote viewing expert, Lyn Buchanan, suggests working through exercises from the book "Drawing On the Right Side of the Brain", by Betty Edwards.</p>

	<p>Before I give you the formula, remember it is vital to deliver the following lines as slowly and seductively as you can. After you ask the questions, shut your mouth and let her speak her piece. Pepper your conversation with numerous pregnant pauses. You’ll give the impression of being sensitive- it’s something women crave.</p>
	<p><u>The hypnotic words that you wish to use are</u></p>
	<p><em>“What about XXX that …”<br/>“How do you <strong>feel</strong> about XXX …” or “What’s <strong>important</strong> to you about that”</em></p>
	<p>Here’s an example:</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong>  So <strong>what do you like</strong> doing for fun in the evenings</p>
	<p><strong>Her:</strong> I enjoy having sex. A lot of wild sex</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Ah. Oh, What particularly do you enjoy about sex</p>
	<p><strong>Her:</strong> It makes me forget my problems. Focus only on the moment. My mind flies free</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> So when you’re having sex, how do you <strong>feel</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Her:</strong> Release. Fun. A lot of freedom. It’ an incredible sensation. Nothing can compare. Makes me want to do it now.</p>
	<p>BAM! You’re now interacting with her at a DEEPER level. And if you didn’t get the last reply, that was already an open invitation for more internal exploring. Take note: <strong>emotional questioning</strong> works on both genders – and even the third gender.</p>
